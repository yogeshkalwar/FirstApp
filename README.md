# FirstApp
iOS FirstApp using MVVP design pattern.

Thanks to https://github.com/popei69/TemplateProject from where I took the reference, mostly code are same, except few package change, plus addition of Builder pattern. 
I will try to modfiy the pattern to be more independent, testable.
Core objective:
1) Have MVVM pattern
2) Full unit testable except view
3) All unit testable code should be in individual package so that code coverage should be higher if not 100%
4) Should be Clean code
